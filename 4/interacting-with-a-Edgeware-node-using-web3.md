# Introduction 

This guide walks through the process of using Web3 to manually sign and send a transaction to a Edgeware EVM dev node. For this example, we will use Node.js and straightforward JavaScript code.

> **Note** This tutorial was created using the release of Edgeware EVM. The Edgeware EVM platform, and the [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) components it relies on for Substrate-based Ethereum compatibility, are still under very active development. We have created this tutorial so you can test out Edgeware's Ethereum compatibility features. Even though we are still in development, we believe itâ€™s important that interested community members and developers have the opportunity to start to try things with Edgeware and provide feedback.

### Checking Prerequisities

Installed [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and particular package manager like [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), rest we have batteries included in this tutorial. 
This guide assumes that you have a [running local Edgeware EVM node running in `--dev` mode.](4/setting-up-a-local-node.md). 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/edgeware-builders/tutorials tutorials;cd tutorials/web3;yarn
```
It will move to your cloned repository, install required packages and you are ready to go!

### Creating Transaction

For this example, we only need a single Javscript file to create the transaction, which we will run using the `node` command in the terminal. The script will transfer 1337 ETH from the genesis account to another address. For simplicity, the file is divided into three sections: variable definition, create transactions and broadcast transaction.

We need to set a couple of values in the variables definitions: 
* Create our Web3 constructor (`web3`)
* Define the `privKey` varibalbe as the private key of our genesis account, which is where all the fund are stored when deploygin your local Edgeware EVM node and what is used to sign the transactions
* Set the "from" and "to" address, making sure to set the value of `toAddress` to a different address, for example the one created by MetaMask when setting up a local wallet


```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');

const privKey =
  '99B3C12287537E38C90A9219D4CB074A89A16E9CDB20BF85728EBD97C343E342'; // Genesis private key
const addressFrom = '0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b';
const addressTo = '0xB90168C8CBcd351D069ffFdA7B71cd846924d551';
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:9933');
```



```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');

const privKey =
  '99B3C12287537E38C90A9219D4CB074A89A16E9CDB20BF85728EBD97C343E342'; // Genesis private key
const addressFrom = '0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b';
const addressTo = '0xB90168C8CBcd351D069ffFdA7B71cd846924d551';
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:9933');

// Create transaction
const deploy = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Attempting to make transaction from ${addressFrom} to ${addressTo}`
  );

  const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
      from: addressFrom,
      to: addressTo,
      value: web3.utils.toWei('1337', 'ether'),
      gas: '2100000000',
    },
    privKey
  );

  // Deploy transaction
  const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    createTransaction.rawTransaction
  );
  console.log(
    `Transaction successful with hash: ${createReceipt.transactionHash}`
  );
};

deploy();
```

### Play time 

Run `node balance.js` to check initial balance on accounts

### We want to hear from you

This is obviously a simple example, but it provides context for how you can start working with Edgeware and how you can try out it's Ethereum compability features. We are interested in hearing abou your experience and following the steps in this guide or your experience trying other Etheruem-based tools with Edgeware. [Feel free to join us in the channels (Discord, Element, Telegram)](https://linktr.ee/edg_developers). We would love to hear your feedback on Edgeware EVM and answer any questions that you may have.
