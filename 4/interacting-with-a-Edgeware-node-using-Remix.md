### Introduction 

This guide walks through the process of creating and deploying a Solidity-based smart contract to a Edgeware dev node using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Remix is one of the commonly used development environments for smart contracts on Ethereum. Given Edgewareâ€™s Ethereum compatibility features, Remix can be used directly with a Edgeware node.

This guide assumes that you have a running local Edgeware node running in `--dev` mode, and that you have a MetaMask installation configured to use this local node. [You can find instructions for running a local Edgeware EVM node](4/setting-up-a-local-node.md) and [to configure MetaMask for Edgeware](4/interacting-with-a-Edgeware-node-using-metamask.md).

### Interacting With Edgeware Using Remix

[Open Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and click on the `New File`

![Remix-New-File](./assets/remix-new-file.png)

Name your file, in our case we've named it `erc20.sol` - yes, that [famous token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

![Remix-Name-File](./assets/remix-name-file.png)

Now add code. Here we are using simple ERC-20 contract based on the current Open Zeppelin ERC-20 template. It creates `MyFirstToken` with symbol `HEDGE` and mints the entirety of the initial supply to the creator of the contract. 

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import 'https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.1.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol';

// This ERC-20 contract mints the specified amount of tokens to the contract creator.
contract MyFirstToken is ERC20 {
  constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyFirstToken", "HEDGE") public {
    _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
  }
}
```

![Remix-Add-Code](./assets/remix-add-code.png)

On the left sidebar, you will click on Solidity compiler and Compile erc20.sol 

```
Solidity Compiler >>> Compile Contract
```

![Remix-Compile-Contract](./assets/remix-compile-contract.png)

Now click to the `Deploy & Run Transactions` on the left in the sidebar and open Metamask to check if is our account connected. If it's connected you can skip to next steps

![Remix-Open-MM](./assets/remix-open-mm.png)

Select our account, in this case it's `Account 4` and click on **connect**

![Remix-Connect-MM](./assets/remix-connect-mm.png)

You will now head to deploy contract. Just before that, make sure you've set set **ENVIRONMENT** to `Injected Web3` and Account that we've imported. Hint, it should have some Eth. To the input next deploy input `initialSupply`, in our case it's 21M. Since this contract uses the default of 18 decimals, the value you will put there is `21000000000000000000000000`

![Remix-Click-Deploy](./assets/remix-click-deploy.png)

You will hit **confirm**! 

![Remix-MM-confirm](./assets/remix-mm-confirm.png)

You will see your contract has been successfully deployed. 

![Remix-deployed-contract](./assets/remix-deployed-contract.png)

You can see your contract deployment details, that has been successfully deployed on Edgeware EVM

![Remix-contrac-deployment](./assets/remix-contract-deployment.png)

You can now click to call functions like `decimals`, `name`, `symbol`, `totalSupply`

### What's next?

You can copy your contracts address and add it to Metamask to play out! Have fun, stay safe!
